Upgrade Ideas (brainstorm backlog)

Offense
- Crit Damage Up: Increase critMultiplier per level.
- Projectile Speed Up: Increase projectileSpeed per level (revisit impact post-testing).

Side Cannons
- Side Ricochet: Side shots bounce off screen edges once; main cannon later when borders exist.
- Side Flat Fire: Side cannons fire horizontally (90° left/right) instead of angled.

On-Kill Explosions
- Brick Kill Explosion (Sides): On brick death, deal flat damage (5–10) to left and right neighbors.
- Brick Kill Explosion (Diagonals): On brick death, deal flat damage to up-left, up-right, down-right, down-left.

Overflow
- Overflow Overspill II: Apply overkill carry to one additional brick above (total 2 bricks).

Passives (AFK)
- Passive Panel: New UI section for helper ships (always active, cannot be destroyed).
- Helper Ship I (Currency): Periodically shoots a brick; on hit grants currency. Works AFK; later add offline accrual.
- Offline Earnings: Separate upgrade enabling currency accrual while offline (cap + sync on return).
- Helper Ship II (Power): Additional helper that shoots and can be upgraded for damage/fire rate over time.

Notes
- Prioritize minimal wiring first; add tuning fields (damage, speed, lifetime, angle, amounts) in definitions.
- Keep per-upgrade costs/levels data-driven in ScriptableObjects.

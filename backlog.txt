[question] does grave bomb placement work reliable?

[bug] Brick Kill Explosion can chain-react with Expansion after adding 2 extra dmg levels (now 7). Expected: no chain reaction; verify depth/damage application and guard flags.

Done

[bug] shards are white when explosion kill

[bug] currency counter in death panel is not updated correctly, meaning the actuall currency counter can still collect money, and the currency counter does not get updated once death panel is open
[task] add a earned this run currency counter to the death panel

[tech]
[tech] set Application.runInBackground = true in startup (Project Settings already set)

[idea]
[idea] make options highly customizable, not one big toggle for turn off all vfx or camera shake, but maybe dampen camera shake, disable side cannon sfx, very granular options
[idea] Stage Clear Bonus scaling upgrades: base multiplier, additive base boost, per-wall mastery multiplier, milestone bonus (e.g., every 5 clears +X), and a rare proc that doubles the bonus.
[idea] maybe add challenges to the game for more depth for progression
[idea] add effect like a wall crumble on stage clear
[idea] super crit chance, but not sure what a super crit should do
[idea] future brick variants: bomber, piercing, crit multiplier, freeze-time

[question]
[question] does grave bomb placement work reliable?

[polish]
[polish]lens distortion bump on brick kill
[polish] make bricks interactable on hover in startscreen

[playtest feedback]
we can now clear wall 4, but the ship even after adding the explosive shots and the helper is feeling weak

with a fully maxxed out upgrade tree the ship feels, weak and the helper drone basically does nothing
both the helper drones and the main ship needs to get over all more powerful


DONE

[task] helpers: projectile drone moves left↔right (low dmg, normal ROF)

[task] main cannon: explosive shots
[task] add crt effect

[bug] Brick Kill Explosion can chain-react with Expansion after adding 2 extra dmg levels (now 7). Expected: no chain reaction; verify depth/damage application and guard flags.
[idea] when we have a auto run system, or for passives, we can make an upgrade to increase stage clear bonus
[idea] when we have a auto run system, or for passives, we can make an upgrade to increase stage clear bonus

[task] options menu

[bug] shards are white when explosion kill
[task] add label describer for death over panel to clarify what is total currency and gained last run
[task] bundle shard pings, so shard pings that fly towards currency counter can bundle if there are enough like 10 or so [next-minimum]

[bug] currency counter in death panel is not updated correctly, meaning the actuall currency counter can still collect money, and the currency counter does not get updated once death panel is open
[task] add a earned this run currency counter to the death panel

[task] add a hint on stage clear panel (hint: be warned to progress too early to next stage)
[task] add retry option next to continue button for stage clear panel
[task] in pass through ui, the wave cleared text says wave 0 cleared instead of wave 1

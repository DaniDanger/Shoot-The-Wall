WORKFLOW

- Next Minimum Task (NEXT_MINIMUM_TASK.txt)
  - Keep exactly one tiny, concrete task (15â€“60 min).
  - At session start: do this task first.
  - At session end: update it for the next session.

- Backlog (backlog.txt)
  - Capture ideas/bugs/tasks as concise entries; multi-line allowed.
  - Optional tags: [bug], [idea], [task], [polish], [tech], [maybe]. Use only if helpful.
  - When an item is completed, move it to the Done section.

- Choosing the next minimum task (end of session)
  - If you already have a clear task, write it directly.
  - Otherwise, skim backlog and pick the best fit after brief discussion/thinking.

- Goal
  - Reduce startup friction so each session begins with one clear next step.
